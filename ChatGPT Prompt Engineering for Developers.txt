Through this course, I learned the fundamental of openai and the essential principles of prompting, i.e., writing clear and specific instructions and giving the model time to think. We saw how to use iterative statements to input multiple inputs simultaneously. Another key learning was following prompt instructions of being transparent and specific, analyzing what caused the production of undesirable output, refining the prompt, and repeating the process. This model can summarize text input by the users. We also saw that the model can infer the user's sentiment and how it can transform input and output from one format to another. This model also expands a short, limited amount of data into an email or an essay. Finally, we created an AI Chatbot for a restaurant using the LLM model.
