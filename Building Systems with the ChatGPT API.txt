This course taught me about different types of LLM and how to apply them using suitable prompts.
We accessed the API from the openai library by generating a unique key and incorporating it in the environment variable in the root directory of our project to use the gpt-3.5-turbo model. We learned that LLM models understand texts by breaking them into tokens, and LLM is used to classify the user message into different categories. We learned about moderation, a method used to determine if the given texts follow moral principles. We learned how to avoid prompt injunctions using a delimiter. We saw how we can divide the input into simpler subtasks to let the model react better to the problem, and it reduces the cost as well. At last, we saw different ways of evaluating our outputs and models.
