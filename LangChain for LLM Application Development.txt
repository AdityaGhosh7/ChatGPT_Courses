In this course, I learned how LangChain interacts with LLMs. We use prompt templates because prompts can sometimes be long, and it is better to reuse them when possible. LangChain facilitates handling prompts, models, and parsers. We learned what chains are, i.e., when we combine a prompt with an LLM and output parsing, and different types of chains such as simple sequential, sequential, and router. We learned how to maintain a memory of errors and feedback and use them to prevent repeating mistakes. We saw that agents decide the course of action to choose and the order of usage of a tool to observe the output.
